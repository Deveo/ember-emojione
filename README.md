`ember-emojione` is your emoji solution for Ember, based on the [EmojiOne](http://emojione.com/) project.

Currently a work in progress, here's what it's gonna offer:

* [x] `inject-emoji` helper to hydrate a string containing emoji codes with emoji HTML tags ([#13](https://github.com/Deveo/ember-emojione/issues/13))
* [x] `emoji-picker` component to select/insert emoji ([#17](https://github.com/Deveo/ember-emojione/issues/17))
* [ ] Components to help you insert emoji while typing ([#26](https://github.com/Deveo/ember-emojione/issues/26))

## Comparison to ember-cli-emojione

`ember-cli-emojione` is an addon that wraps the `emojione` Bower package into an ES module. The `emojione` global is still available.

The `emojione` Bower package is over 90 MiB large, making installation and CI builds substantially slower. If you're serving your emoji from the free JSDelivr CDN or your own hosting, `emojione` assets aren't needed in the Ember app.

This addon, `ember-emojione`, imports only the `emojione.js` library (~50 KiB large gzipped).

If you want, you can manually import EmojiOne CSS and sprite files, or even the whole `emojione` Bower package. Please see below how to do that.

For the simplicity of importing manually, `ember-emojione` does not offer an ES module. If you need low-level access to the EmojiOne JS library, please use the `emojione` global var.



## Installation

In order not to increase you app's distro size more than you need, this addon does not bundle any of it's dependencies.

You'll have to install the dependencies manually, depending your your preference. This makes the installation process quite elaborate. Please read carefully.



### 1. Installing the addon itself

With npm:

    ember install ember-emojione
    
With Yarn:

    yarn add -D ember-emojione




### 2. Installing the EmojiOne library

The `emojione` package is very large: over 90 MiB. For many developers, having it on `bower.json` is a burden. For this reason, `ember-emojione` is not bundling this dependency.

You'll have to include the dependency manually, and there are options




#### Option 1: including only the necessary assets (recommended)

As EmojiOne by default works with the free JSDevilr CDN, you don't actually need to fetch EmojiOne assets.

The bare minimum for the `inject-emoji` helper are the JS and CSS files. To use the components, you'll also need the JSON file with emoji definitions.

Luckily, Bower allows downloading individual files as individual dependencies:

First, include the EmojiOne JS library (note that the package name is `emojione-js` and not simply `emojione`):

    bower install -S emojione-js=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/lib/js/emojione.js

Then include the CSS. Here you have two options.

Normal CSS, works with: individual PNGs, individual SVGs and SVG sprite sheet:

    bower install -S emojione-css=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/assets/css/emojione.css
 
 Or, if you want to use PNG sprite sheet, add this CSS:
 
    bower install -S emojione-css=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.css

If you're gonna use the components, you'll also need emoji definitons:

    bower install -S emojione-defs=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/emoji.json

You can also include the sprite sheet this way. You only need this if you don't want to use the free CDN and instead want to serve assets locally. Use **one** of the following:

    bower install -S emojione-png=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.png
    bower install -S emojione-svg=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg



#### Option 2: including the whole `emojione` package

Including the whole package, which is over 90 MiB large, is only reasonable if you want to use individual images rather than sprite sheets AND you want to serve them locally rather than via the free CDN.

Simply install it via:

    bower install -S emojione

Note: your app's distro size will not grow by 90 MiB. In the next installation step, you'll decide what assets to include into the distro.

But every clean `bower install` will likely be substantially slower. That includes your CI builds.



### 3. Including the assets

Open your app's `ember-cli-build.js`:



#### 3.1 Include the CSS and JS files

```js
var Funnel = require("broccoli-funnel");

module.exports = function (defaults) {
  /* ... */
  
  app.import(app.bowerDirectory + "/emojione-js/index.js");
  app.import(app.bowerDirectory + "/emojione-css/index.css");

  return app.toTree();
};
```



#### 3.2 Include the assets (optional)

Skip this step if you are happy to serve assets from the free CDN (or own CDN, independently from your app's distro).

If you want to serve assets from within your app's distro, you have to tell Ember CLI to move the assets into the public folder.

Use [broccoli-funnel](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-funnel) to import assets. You'll have to figure out how to it yourself, taking into consideration:
 
 * which package installation method you chose;
 * the path to assets within the `bower_components/` folder.

Here are a couple of examples:

##### PNG sprites with a custom package (installation method 1)

```js
  var emojiOneSprite = new Funnel(app.bowerDirectory, {
      srcDir: "emojione-png",
      destDir: "assets/emojione",
      include: ['*.png']
  });

  return app.toTree([emojiOneSprite]);
```



#### individual SVGs with the full package (installation method 2)

```js
  var emojiOneSVGs = new Funnel(app.bowerDirectory + "/emojione", {
    srcDir: "assets/svg",
    destDir: "assets/emojione/svg"
  })

  return app.toTree([emojiOneSVGs]);
```



### 3. Include emoji definitions

This step is necessary only if you're gonna use this addon's components. If you only need the helper to render emoji, skip this step.



## Configuration

`ember-emojione` relies on [emojione.js defaults](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/v2.2.7/lib/js/emojione.js#L150-L157).

To configure `ember-emojione` and override `emojione` options, add these options to your app's `config/environment.js`. Default values are shown:

```js
"ember-emojione": {

  // Used to skip certain portions of the input string.
  // Useful for Markdown code blocks. Apply after Markdown transformation.
  // Set to `false` to disable.
  regexToSkip: /<code[\s\S]*?>[\s\S]*?<\/code>/gm,
  
  // EmojiOne library options
  emojione: {
    imagePathPNG:        'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/png/',
    imagePathSVG:        'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/',
    imagePathSVGSprites: './../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg',
    imageType:           'png', // or svg
    imageTitleTag:       true,  //set to false to remove title attribute from img tag
    sprites:             false, // if this is true then sprite markup will be used (if SVG image type is set then you must include the SVG sprite file locally)
    unicodeAlt:          true,  // use the unicode char as the alt attribute (makes copy and pasting the resulting text better)
    ascii:               false, // change to true to convert ascii smileys
  }
}
```

Configuration is optional.

Note: the path PNG sprite file is configured elsewhere. If you need to customize it, override the background image:

```css
.emojione {
  background-image: url('path/to/your/emojione.sprites.png');
}
```



## Usage

### `inject-emoji` helper

This helper is used to convert a string with emoji codes into a string of HTML with emoji images.

You must manually mark the input string as HTML-safe:

```js
{
  inputStr: Ember.String.htmlSafe("Hi! :sunglasses:")
}
```

By doing so you acknowledge responsibility that the input string will never contain malicious code. Neglecting this responsibility will make your app/website prone to XSS attacks.

Use triple curlies to inject HTML into your template:

```handlebars
<div>
  {{{inject-emoji inputStr}}}
</div>
```

Result:

```handlebars
<div>
  Hi! <img class="emojione" alt="ðŸ˜Ž" title=":sunglasses:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/png/1f60e.png?v=2.2.7"/>
</div>
```



### Overriding options

You can override `ember-emojione` and `emojione.js` options for a single invocation of `inject-emoji`:

```hbs
<div>
  {{{inject-emoji inputStr (hash
    regexToSkip = false
    emojione = (hash
      imageType = 'svg'
      sprites   = true
    )
  )}}}
</div>
```



### Use from JS

You can inject emoji programmatically via the `injectEmoji` convenience function:

```js
import {injectEmoji} from 'ember-emojione/helpers/inject-emoji';

injectEmoji(inputString, options);
```


It returns an html-safe string if the input was html-safe. Otherwise, it returns a regular string.

```js
import {htmlSafe} from 'ember-string';
import isHTMLSafe from 'ember-string-ishtmlsafe-polyfill';
import {injectEmoji} from 'ember-emojione/helpers/inject-emoji';

const options = {regexToSkip: false, emojiOne: {ascii: true}};



const inputUnsafeString  = ':D';
const resultUnsafeString = injectEmoji(inputUnsafeString, options);

isHTMLSafe(resultUnsafeString) // => false
typeof resultUnsafeString;     // => "string"



const inputSafeString  = htmlSafe(inputUnsafeString);
const resultSafeString = injectEmoji(inputSafeString, options);

isHTMLSafe(resultSafeString);       // => true
typeof resultSafeString;            // => "object"
typeof resultSafeString.toString(); // => "string"
```



### Skipping code blocks

`inject-emoji` will ignore emoji located within portions of the input string that match given regular expression.

The regex can be configured via the `regexToSkip` option.

By default, the regex matches `<code>...</code>` elements.

To disable skipping, set `regexToSkip` to `false`.



## Importing `emojione` CSS and JS assets

For quicker installation and CI builds, this addon only imports EmojiOne's [js file](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/master/lib/js/emojione.js) directly.

By default, EmojiOne assets are served from the "free and super-fast" [JSDelivr](http://jsdelivr.com) CDN, so no EmojiOne images have to be downloaded into your project.

If you want to add a sprite sheet as a local asset, it is recommended to include SVG or CSS and PNG files as individual packages:

    bower i -S emojione-css=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.css
    bower i -S emojione-png=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ranks/emojione/v2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.png

Then you can import them from your `ember-cli-build.js` file:

```js
var Funnel = require("broccoli-funnel");

module.exports = function (defaults) {
  /* ... */
  
  app.import(app.bowerDirectory + "/emojione-css/index.css");
  
  var emojiOneSprite = new Funnel(app.bowerDirectory, {
      srcDir: "emojione-png",
      destDir: "assets",
      include: ['*.png']
  });

  return app.toTree([emojiOneSprite]);
};
```

### Branch names

Main branches are named as `gen-1`, `gen-2`, etc. Default branch on GitHub is where active development happens.

This naming scheme is due to the fact that this project uses SemVer. As a result, major version number will rise very quickly, without any correlation with actual major changes in the app.

The number in the branch name, "generation", is supposed to be incremented in these cases:
* A huge improvement or change happens in the addon.
* There's a change in the addon's API or architecture which introduces a necessity to maintain more than one branch at a time.
* The codebase is started from scratch.

Pull requests are welcome from feature branches. Make sure to discus proposed changes with addon maintainers to avoid wasted effort.
